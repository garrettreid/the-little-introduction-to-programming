  <h2>Applying What We've Learned</h2>
  <p>This chapter is different than the ones we've seen so far. It'll let us apply what we've learned interactively. We'll be putting together a shopping list to build up our knowledge through small and simple steps. We'll also introduce new and more powerful concepts.</p>

  <p>In this chapter you'll be asked to provide some code in order to fufill a certain purpose. The output of this code will be diplayed on the right. Don't be afraid to try different solutions; and if you aren't sure what to type, you can always view the answer via the <em>answer</em> button. Do as much or as little as you want - we all learn differently and at a different pace.</p>

  <h3>Lay Of The Land</h3>
  <p>The first thing we'll do is get comfortable with this new interactive environment. Every interactive section has the same six components. You should familiarize yourself with all six.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>First, in the top right is your <em>shopping list</em> When you run your code, you'll see this list get updated. This is also where any error messages will show up.</li>
    <li>Next, you have an <em>coding area</em>, which is where you can program. The coding area is easy to spot because of how green it is.</li>
    <li>Below the coding area you'll find the <em>run button</em>. Clicking it will run the code found inside the coding area (again, feel free to play around, no one's watching!)</li>
    <li>Since each excercise builds on top of the previous one, a <em>reset button</em> allows you to ensure your shopping list is properly setup. This is useful if you skip a step or if you played around and your shopping list is a message.</li>
    <li>Next to the run button you'll find the an <em>answer button</em> which will show you a possible answer (there's always more than one way solve a programming problem).</li>
    <li>Finally, whenever you are typing inside your coding area, you'll see a <em>functions list</em> below your shopping list. This represents a list of functions you are allowed to use in this particular section.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Let's give it a try. Below you'll find your first <em>coding area</em>. Once you click in it, you'll see that you have 1 function avaible (in the <em>functions list</em>).
